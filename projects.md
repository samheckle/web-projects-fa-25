# Projects for this Semester
## On Documentation

Documentation is a required component of every project, and will be submitted with the project link and the code. You are welcome to write your documentation in the discussion post, or you are welcome to have an external blog hosted on your site or with another tool (powerpoints, figma, miro, google docs, notion, etc) as long as I have access to it. 

Requirements for documentation:
1. No high level overviews! Literally walk me through your artistic process: 
    * what did you try? what succeeded and what didn't?
2.  Mood boards, sketches, inspiration
    * what projects were particularly useful in creating your site?
    * what helped you in determining the aesthetic?
    * did you make any sketches (illustrator, procreate, figma, miro, google docs, pen and paper)?
3. What were things you experimented with?
    * What experiment put you on the path for your final design? Take screenshots & screen recordings of any visual outputs.
4. Include any links
    * Citation of AI usage
    * Any other projects you referenced code from
    * StackOverflow

## Project #1 - HyperText Narrative
***Due 9/15***  
Using HTML and CSS, create a hypertext narrative which reveals something about yourself, or about an experience you’ve had. Think about narrative structures hypertext allows you to create (e.g. branching narrative, looping narrative,) and try to understand how they can best serve the story you are trying to tell. You are allowed to use words and images.

Keep styling to a minimum – don’t go beyond background & foreground colors, and maybe font size – in order to keep your focus on the storytelling and interaction. Use the`<br/>` and `<hr/>` tags, or the entity to control spacing in your piece.

Within this minimal styling, make give some thought to how color, scale, spacing and the relationship between words and images shape the experience of navigating your website. Also consider the other affordances offered by the browser: maybe the HTML page name or address bar are part of your work, or maybe the work requires to be seen in a browser window of a certain size.

### Deliverables
***Due 9/15: Project #1***
* You will turn in a website, hosted on Hunter's SFTP system. Your home page should be called `index.html` and all other pages should be reachable (or not) from it via hyperlinks. 
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the website (eg. `https://film1.hunter.cuny.edu/NET-ID/project1/`)
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)

## Project #2 - Screensaver
Due 10/6

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create a screensaver that lives in the web browser. You are welcome to use CSS Animations or animations in p5.js. You should only use one HTML page. Think about screensavers as the moment where the computer rests without the control of the user. 

### Deliverables
Due 9/29: Project #2 Concept  
Come up with a concept for your project and write documentation bout it. Include a short description, 1 -2 sketches, and references of relevant projects. 

Due 10/6: Project #2  
Project is due, with a link to your Hunter server inside `project2/`.
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the website (eg. `https://film1.hunter.cuny.edu/NET-ID/project2/`)
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)
### Examples & Inspiration

## Project #3: Midterm
Due 10/27
Build a forum or blog site for a community. Your community will be the client who has commissioned you to design and develop a public-facing site.   
Your chosen community can be real (a Hunter student organization, your 5th grade summer camp, a community brought together by a shared passion for X, etc.). fictional (the group of all your childhood imaginary friends, etc.) or anywhere in between (the plants in your apartment, the bacteria that makes up your microbiome, etc.)  
Make sure you are clear on who the audience for your website is (e.g. members of the community vs outsiders,) and that your design caters to your selected audiences, while staying truthful to the nature of the community. At the same time, make sure to consider the *content* of the website. Does your community have a manifesto? A list of members? A schedule? And is the content coming from a different website of the same community? Are you writing it? Does an AI write it? Are the users creating most of it?

### Deliverables
Due 10/14 - Project #3 Concept  
Choose the community you want to focus on, and come up with a design for the website you want to build. A common structure is to have a header, a footer, a landing page and a few content pages, but don’t feel constrained by this. Use a digital tool to create your **site map** and **wireframes** (Figma, Google Slides, Canva, Miro, etc.) Begin working on the visual design of the site as well.

Due 10/27 - Project #3  
Project is due, with a link to your Hunter server inside `project3/`.
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the website (eg. `https://film1.hunter.cuny.edu/NET-ID/project3/`)
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)

## Project #4 - Bluesky Bot
Due 11/17  
Create an account on BlueSky and make a bot that runs automatically! What is the interval it posts at? Try bigger times, like once a day or once a week. Think about using an external api to produce content.   

### Deliverables
Due 11/17 
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the bot on bluesky
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)

### Examples and Inspiration
* Allison Parrish, [everyword](https://twitter.com/everyword?lang=en)
* Darius Kazemi, [bot summit](http://tinysubversions.com/2013/11/bot-summit/) -- sadly a lot of these bots are removed from twitter aka x (which is also why we are using Mastodon)
* Colin Mitchell, [botsin.space](https://botsin.space/public/local) -- a mastodon server specifically for bots

## Project #5 - Final
Due 12/15
For your final project, you will design and build a website starting from *one* of the following four prompts:

- a website that evolves over time;
- a website that is different for every one of its visitors;
- a website that is a gift to someone you care about;

These are broad prompts meant to get you started, and can be interpreted as literally or abstractly as you see fit. As usual, you are encouraged to bring your own design and artistic interests into this project. Regardless of which prompt you end up choosing, your website should take advantage of the fact that it lives in a networked environment, and should use the web browser’s affordances in meaningful ways to convey your concept.

### Deliverables
Due 12/1  
Choose your starting prompt, and come up with a concept and design for your website. Do your research as well, for both concept and visual style: other websites, pieces of art, zines, posters, books, installations, etc. You should design each page your website will have, in order to fully focus on the implementation over the following weeks.

Due 12/15  
The project is due, as a website hosted on your Hunter server.
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the website (eg. `https://film1.hunter.cuny.edu/NET-ID/project5/`)
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)
