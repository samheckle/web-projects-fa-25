## Nginx Config

1. ssh into your droplet

```sh
ssh root@your.ip.address
```

2. open the editor for the nginx configuration file, replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain name.

```sh
nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/yourdomain.com.conf
```

3. change the configuration file under the comment `# reverse proxy`. remember you cannot use your mouse, so you need to use arrow keys to move your cursor around.

```sh
    # reverse proxy
    location /project4/ {
        proxy_pass            http://127.0.0.1:5001/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        include               nginxconfig.io/proxy.conf;
    }

    location /project3/ {
        proxy_pass            http://127.0.0.1:7002/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        include               nginxconfig.io/proxy.conf;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass            http://127.0.0.1:3002/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        include               nginxconfig.io/proxy.conf;
    }
```

The server block operates like an if-statement, so we want the most generic one on the bottom. We are also adding our project3 here, along with our project4. Make sure your port names are correct (they might be different from mine, so check each `server.js` file in `webserver`, `project3`, and `project4`).

## Project 4 Share
