## Course Description
Prerequisites: Creative Code (MEDP 234) and Web Production 2 (MEDP 331)  
Advanced programming skills for website design. Dynamic content development explored through state of the art programming languages for the creation of interactive web sites. Students will create web pages that utilize the most current techniques in web development.  The curriculum in this class emphasizes an integrated and creative approach to web programming, including detailed instruction and practice in the technical aspects. It is designed to give students a basic introduction to the tools and techniques used by web programmers. 

## Learning Objectives
* Solid understanding of both front-end (HTML/CSS, JavaScript), and back-end (JavaScript) development
* Be able to understand web publishing and what it means to create public-facing websites

## Class Format & Expectations
### Format
Students are expected to spend 6-9 hours per week on this class. Outside of class, students are expected to find additional help with any technical materials, reading any assigned materials, and working on class projects. Some weeks will be lighter than others. 

In general, every class will contain some of the following:
* sharing (lecture, show & tell of examples)
* discussion (conversations about projects and materials)
* working (group exercises, designing, coding, troubleshooting)
* critique (spending time with your own and others' work, observing, conversing)
### Expectations
1) Try your best
2) Experiment with cool things that interest you
3) Reach out if you have issues with code
4) Follow along with code demos

## Required Course Tools
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    * make an account if you don't have one already
    * Windows users need to install [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/). If you need help, here is a [tutorial](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/git-command-line-on-windows-with-git-bash/#how-to-install-git-bash)
* Text Editor
    * I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but you are welcome to use any in this class
* Browser
    * Ideally Firefox or Chrome.
* SFTP - Safe File Transfer Protocol
    * We will be using the hunter sites to create our public websites, and you will need an SFTP client.
    * Download FileZilla (Windows or MacOS) or Cyberduck (MacOS)
    * [Hunter SFTP Tutorial](https://cuny907-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/samantha_heckle26_login_cuny_edu/ETxIH3SJoLZMsVAZg0mHqdoBVOgHcAItXQKIbhye8RnKbA?e=Ll1Vc1)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Since the class is on zoom, it will probably be helpful to have access to a second screen to be able to follow along with the tutorial and code at the same time. 

## Grading
| | |
|---|---|
| Participation | 30% |
| Projects | 20% |
| Midterm | 20% |
| Final | 30% |

This class is about learning and experimenting with web-based material. Because of this, I am most interested in seeing your process and having an active engagement with the course. 

| | |
|---|---|
| A | <ul><li>showing up to class on time, camera on, and regularly participating<li>regular communication<li>submitting work on time<ul> |
| B | <ul><li>miss less than 4 classes<li>occasional communication<li>few late assignments<ul> |
| C / D |<ul><li>miss more than 4 classes<li>little communication<li>late/missing assignments<ul> |
| F |<ul><li>miss more than 6 classes<li>no communication<li>missing assignments<ul> |

## Attendance & Participation

As listed above, if you miss more than 4 classes your grade will be impacted. This includes not turning your camera on or attending class late. Please be on top of communication with me. I am not here to be your boss, but I am here as your teacher to practice engaging in professional environments. If something happens, please let me know. 

Participation can appear in many forms: asking questions, going to office hours, sending and reading emails, class group discussion, arriving on time, going to class, taking notes, listening to peers, following instructions, active listening, etc. If you are actively engaging in class you will receive full participation.

## Late Assignments & Extensions

Assignments are considered late the moment the due date has passed on BrightSpace. For every day an assignment is submitted late, there will be a 10% deduction with a maximum of 50% of the assignment grade.

An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an extension 24-hours before the due date, your grade will not be affected. However, if you do not request an extension, the grading rules above apply. Please reach out to me so we can figure out a system that works together.

Note: There may be instances where having an extension may result in not being able to participate fully in activities such as feedback sessions or workshopping ideas/projects, which likely cannot be made up if it could disrupt the overall course schedule. Extensions are done by discretion.

* If you use AI at any stage in the creation of your project (including initial stages, idea generation, drafting, language translation, and final form), you must properly cite and disclose this use. This should include details on the specific tool and version used, as well as the nature of your usage (for example, in programming code, images, and/or text/writing).
* Citation should reference both the platform and any creator (“style of”) names or references.
